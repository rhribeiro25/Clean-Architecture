# Software Architecture

This project combines a wide range of software engineering concepts to create an efficient and maintainable solution:

- Sorting and Searching Algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Linear Search, and Binary Search, optimize data management and retrieval.
- DTO (Data Transfer Object) ensures clean separation of data across layers, improving scalability.
- Builder Design Pattern simplifies the creation of complex objects.
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) focuses on aligning the software model with business requirements, enhancing collaboration and clarity.
- Clean Architecture promotes modularity, separation of concerns, and long-term maintainability.
- Integration with PostgreSQL ensures reliable, scalable data storage, while REST APIs provide a seamless interface for communication.
- Following SOLID principles helps in creating flexible and extensible systems, making the codebase easy to maintain and extend over time.
- These technologies work together to build a robust and scalable application, following industry best practices for software development.
